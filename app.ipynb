    "McDonaldâ€™s food items are often controversial because of their high fat and sodium content. Using this dataset from Kaggle, I will perform a nutrition analysis of every menu item, including salads, beverages, and desserts. \n",
    "\n",
    "How many calories does the average McDonald's value meal contain? How much do beverages, like soda or coffee, contribute to the overall caloric intake? Does ordered grilled chicken instead of crispy increase a sandwich's nutritional value? What about ordering egg whites instead of whole eggs? What is the least number of items could you order from the menu to meet one day's nutritional requirements?\n",
